# personal-scripts
These are my personal scripts I use on all of my Linux systems for convenience.

### passmenu2

This script is based on the passmenu2 script from [Suckless.org](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/scripts/). Currently, the only modification is the inclusion of pass otp IF the file is named otp. For example, github/otp will be accessed with pass otp, while github/pass will not.
